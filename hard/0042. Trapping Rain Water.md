# 42. Trapping Rain Water
> https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/

- `Two pointers`
- T: O(n), S: O(1)

```py
# Notice: Always move the index with the smaller height. This is because, in order to form a trap area, there must be a height that is greater or equal. In other words, the case to avoid is when we keep moving the left pointer while calculating the area, only to find that the list is in descending order, which means it cannot hold any water.

# Algo
# 0. When len(h) <=2: return 0
# 1. Store l_max, r_max and l, r two pointers
# 2. While l < r (trap only can l < r)
#   - h[l] > h[r]: left case
#     2.1. Update max left height
#.    2.2. Add answer + l_max - h[l]
#     2.3. l +=1
#.  - else: right case


class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(height)
        if n <= 2:
            return 0
        
        answer = 0
        l_max, r_max = 0, 0
        l, r = 0, n-1

        while l < r:
            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l_max = max(l_max, height[l])
                answer += (l_max - height[l])
                l += 1
            else:
                r_max = max(r_max, height[r])
                answer += (r_max - height[r])
                r -= 1
        return answer
```
