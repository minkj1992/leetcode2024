"""Algo
1. Find min and max(r) -> mid ranges ~ [min, max]
    - We can find min x by 'hx = min(piles)' && x > 0
    - Max is max(piles)
2. Calculate time (t): sum([ceil(p/mid) for p in piles])
3. Compare t vs h
    3.1. t == h: we ceil(x) now so, it can be candidate but it cannot ensures it is best k so treat it as case 3.3.
    3.2. t > h: mid(k) is too small -> l = mid + 1
    3.3. t < h: mid is too big -> r = mid - 1
      - but best case may not exist so we have to track big t case -> so candidate = min(candidate, mid)
