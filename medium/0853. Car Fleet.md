# 853. Car Fleet
> https://leetcode.com/problems/car-fleet/description/

- `Stack`


#### Algo: O(nlogn)
1. Calculate each car's arrival time (target - position) / speed
2. Generate times list with sorted postion list
3. Iterating times reversely and keep longest arrival_time 
4. If longest < cur_time: longest = cur_time and answer += 1
    - This means current car cannot become fleet with right section

```py
def calculate_time(distance: int, speed: int) -> float:
        return float(distance) / speed

class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: List[int], speed: List[int]) -> int:
        times = []
        for p, s in sorted(zip(position, speed)):
            t = calculate_time(target - p, s)
            times.append(t)

        answer, longest = 0, 0
        for t in times[::-1]:
            if longest < t:
                answer += 1
                longest = t
        return answer

```
